# civitai-sync-termux-exiftool
I developed a portable solution to manage and search Civitai-generated images on my Android device. Using Termux, ExifTool, and a custom Bash script, I can efficiently organize and retrieve images based on EXIF metadata, overcoming the limitations of Civitai's browsing capabilities and Android photo viewers.
