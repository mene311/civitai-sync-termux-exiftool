Description:

This project enhances the portability and efficiency of managing AI-generated images from Civitai on Android devices. Leveraging Termux, a powerful terminal emulator for Android, and ExifTool, a robust metadata manipulation tool, users can download, organize, and search their Civitai generations directly on their mobile devices.

Key Features:

Civitai Sync Integration: Utilizes civitai-sync to download AI-generated images from Civitai, ensuring your creations are always up-to-date.

Metadata Search with ExifTool: Employs ExifTool to embed and search image metadata, allowing for efficient keyword-based searches directly on your device.

Bash Scripting for Automation: Includes custom Bash scripts to automate the download and organization process, providing a seamless user experience.

Termux Environment: Runs entirely within Termux, eliminating the need for a separate PC and offering true portability.


Background:

Civitai's web-based image explorer lacks advanced browsing capabilities, and existing Android photo viewers do not support EXIF metadata searches. This project addresses these limitations by creating a mobile solution that allows users to manage and search their AI-generated images on the go.

Setting Up CivitAI Sync and Find&Copy Script on Termux for Android

This guide walks you through setting up CivitAI Sync and a custom Find&Copy Bash Script on Termux, enabling you to efficiently download, organize, and search your AI-generated images using EXIF metadata directly from your Android device.
üì≤ 1. Install Termux and Enable Shared Storage

    Download Termux:
        Install Termux from F-Droid.

    Update and Upgrade Packages:

pkg update && pkg upgrade

Enable Shared Storage Access:

termux-setup-storage

    Grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

Verify Storage Access:

    ls ~/storage/shared

    You should see folders like DCIM, Download, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Install Required Tools

    Install Node.js, Git, and ExifTool:

pkg install nodejs git exiftool

Verify Installations:

    node -v
    git --version
    exiftool -ver

üíª 3. Install CivitAI Sync

    Clone the CivitAI Sync Repository:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/monkeypuzzl/civitai-sync.git
cd civitai-sync

Install Dependencies:

npm install

Run the Configuration Wizard:
Instead of manually editing the configuration file, use the built-in wizard:

npm run cli

    Follow the prompts to set up your API Key and preferences interactively.

Test CivitAI Sync:

    node src/cli.mjs download-latest-generations

        Images should download to ~/civitai-sync/generations.

üîç 4. Set Up the Find&Copy Bash Script

    Create the Script Directory:

mkdir -p ~/scripts
cd ~/scripts

Create the Script File:

nano fnc.sh

Paste the Script:

#!/bin/bash

# Basic Configuration
CARPETA_RAIZ="$HOME/storage/shared/xImages"
CARPETA_ORIGEN="$HOME/storage/shared/civitai_generations"

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 '<search condition>'"
  echo "       $0 -purge"
  exit 1
fi

# Option: -purge
if [ "$1" == "-purge" ]; then
  echo "Removing all folders in $CARPETA_RAIZ..."
  rm -rf "$CARPETA_RAIZ"/*
  echo "Folders removed."
  exit 0
fi

mkdir -p "$CARPETA_RAIZ"

# Get search phrase and clean folder name
PHRASE="$1"
CARPETA_LIMPIA=$(echo "$PHRASE" | sed 's/&&/and/g; s/||/or/g; s/!/not/g' | tr ' ' '_')
CARPETA_DESTINO="$CARPETA_RAIZ/$CARPETA_LIMPIA"
mkdir -p "$CARPETA_DESTINO"

# Generate condition explicitly handling logical operators
CONDITION=""
for TOKEN in $PHRASE; do
  case "$TOKEN" in
    "&&")
      CONDITION="$CONDITION &&"
      ;;
    "||")
      CONDITION="$CONDITION ||"
      ;;
    "!")
      CONDITION="$CONDITION !"
      ;;
    *)
      CONDITION="$CONDITION (\$UserComment =~ /$TOKEN/i)"
      ;;
  esac
done

echo "Generated condition: $CONDITION"

# Run exiftool to copy matching files
exiftool -r -if "$CONDITION" -p "\$Directory/\$Filename" "$CARPETA_ORIGEN" | while read FILE; do
  cp "$FILE" "$CARPETA_DESTINO/" || echo "Error copying $FILE"
done

echo "Images copied to $CARPETA_DESTINO."

Make the Script Executable:

    chmod +x fnc.sh

üöÄ 5. How to Use the Script

    Search for Images with Keywords:

~/scripts/fnc.sh 'elf && Christmas || !Santa'

    Matching images will be copied to ~/storage/shared/xImages/elf_and_Christmas_or_notSanta.

Purge All Results:

~/scripts/fnc.sh -purge

Verify Copied Files:

    ls ~/storage/shared/xImages

üßπ 6. Create Aliases for Convenience

To simplify usage, add these aliases to your .bashrc:

echo "alias civitai-latest='node ~/civitai-sync/src/cli.mjs download-latest-generations'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias findcivitai='~/scripts/fnc.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Usage:

    civitai-latest ‚Üí Download latest generations.
    findcivitai "elf && Christmas" ‚Üí Search and copy images.
    findcivitai -purge ‚Üí Clean all results.

üìÇ 7. Final Check

    Download New Images:

civitai-latest

Search with Keywords:

findcivitai "angel && wings"

Purge Old Results (if needed):

    findcivitai -purge

üéØ Done!

You now have a portable and efficient setup for managing and searching CivitAI-generated images directly on your Android device.

Let me know if you encounter any issues! üöÄ

Note:

While civitai-sync and Windows File Explorer offer robust solutions on their respective platforms, this project focuses on providing similar functionality with the added portability of an Android device.

Future Enhancements:

User-Friendly Interface: Develop a more intuitive interface, possibly with interactive menus, to make the tool accessible to users unfamiliar with command-line operations.

Performance Optimization: Evaluate the impact of recursive scans on devices with limited hardware and include tips to optimize performance.

Community Sharing: Publish the scripts and documentation on a platform like GitHub to facilitate collaboration, updates, and feedback.


By following these steps, users can effectively manage their AI-generated images from Civitai directly on their Android devices, overcoming the limitations of existing tools and achieving true portability.
